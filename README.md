# NonoTrainer

I am a Nonosweeper player with a personal bests of 1.686+16.056+55.43+153.698 = 226.87 and have an account id 77227 on League of Minesweeper. 

This repository contains code to Nonosweeper Enjoyer Discord bot where its function is based on puzzle game Nonograms and Nonosweeper.

The main purpose of the bot is to train player's pattern recognition by playing mini-game with players and show lists of perfect patterns.

This is currently a work in progress. I plan on optimizing my code and adding more functions.
