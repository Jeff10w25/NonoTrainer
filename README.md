# NonoTrainer

This repository contains code to Nonosweeper Enjoyer Discord bot where its function is based on puzzle game Nonograms and Nonosweeper.

I am Nonosweeper player with a personal bests of 1.686+16.056+55.43+153.698 = 226.87 with an account id 77227 on League of Minesweeper. 

The main purpose of the bot is to train player's pattern recognition by playing mini-game with players and show lists of perfect patterns.

This is curenntly a work in progress. I plan on optimizing my code and adding more functions.
